          Mission

Finch was started by 2 friends (Nino & Steph üôáüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôáüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) who struggled with anxiety and depression and found self-care challenging to stick with. We decided to build Finch hoping to make self-care fun and accessible after seeing many others share similar struggles. Finch was launched in 2021, and our team is grateful to have helped over 20 million people on their mental health journeys.

Finch is profitable and we believe in responsible growth. We are a small but mighty team who are passionate about mental health.

Role Summary

Finch has unique product engineering opportunities as it straddles the line between wellness and gaming, and our product challenges reflect that. We‚Äôre passionate about making self-care feel easy and fun for everyone, and strive to design playful, delightful experiences we hope users will love. If those sorts of creative challenges are interesting to you, read on!

Key Responsibilities

You will play a critical role in growing and evolving our app as our 5th engineer.
You will work with high autonomy and speed, and be involved in the end-to-end product development cycle from ideation to launch decisions.
You will have significant input into the norms and tools we use in order to create a high performing engineering team.
You will work cross-functionally with product designers, creative designers, character animators, and the founders.
You will be a thought partner in building a product, company, and culture we are proud of.
Projects You Could Work On

How can we revolutionize the way people interact with their mobile devices to be mentally beneficial instead of mentally degrading?
How can we redefine social interactions that can help people support others in a way that no other product can?
How can we reimagine wellness exercises like CBT, mental health insights, and more to help people navigate the ups and downs in their lives?
How can we create playful product experiences that can make daily self care and mental health fun and sustainably engaging?
How can we create a generalizable platform of mental health tools that can cater to a wide range of experiences, from people still figuring out their self care routines to others who know exactly what they need to do?
Requirements

You have 5+ years experience building consumer products for mobile or full-stack environments.
You have a product-centric mindset and take pride in building experiences people love to use. You naturally identify tradeoffs for any product decision to inform opinions about user experience.

You have experience designing clean and maintainable APIs.
You‚Äôve run many A/B experiments and can make data-informed decisions while balancing qualitative feedback.
You are familiar with best practices in engineering for mobile apps and web and can help build scalable and reliable products.
