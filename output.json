    "CoverLetter": "Dear LawnStarter Hiring Team,\n\nI am writing to express my keen interest in the Software Engineer position at LawnStarter. I have been consistently impressed by LawnStarter's innovative approach to the landscaping industry and its commitment to leveraging technology to improve the customer experience. The opportunity to contribute to a company that is disrupting a traditional sector with modern solutions is particularly exciting to me.\n\nMy experience at Sony Pictures Entertainment, particularly in designing and architecting business applications, has honed my skills in building scalable and reliable systems. As a Tech Lead Engineer, I led the modernization of a legacy Angular.js and Java Spring Boot codebase, which involved upgrading frameworks and remediating security vulnerabilities. This aligns perfectly with the requirements of this role at LawnStarter, where I can contribute to building and maintaining robust APIs and automating workflows.\n\nMy proficiency in Python, React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, AWS, and Docker, as demonstrated in both my professional experience and personal projects, makes me confident in my ability to contribute meaningfully to your team. For example, in my project \"Dolores,\" I optimized the backend to handle high user traffic, ETL'ing over 10 million records with PostgreSQL and implementing Redis data caching, resulting in an average response time of 60ms for 10,000 clients/sec with 0% error rate under stress testing. My full-stack project, \"Animedia,\" showcases my ability to utilize GraphQL for API interactions and ensure end-to-end type safety with TypeScript, further solidifying my qualifications.\n\nI am also adept at using testing frameworks like Jest and React Testing Library to ensure code quality and reliability. My experience as an Environmental Manager at Sony Pictures Entertainment, ensuring the stability of non-production environments, highlights my commitment to maintaining system reliability at scale.\n\nI am eager to learn more about this opportunity and discuss how my skills and experience can contribute to LawnStarter's continued success. Thank you for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\n\nYasin Khan"
