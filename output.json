    "CoverLetter": "Dear LawnStarter Hiring Team,\n\nI am writing to express my strong interest in the Software Engineer position at LawnStarter. Having followed LawnStarter's growth and innovative approach to the landscaping industry for some time, I'm particularly excited by the opportunity to contribute to a company that is revolutionizing a traditional sector with technology.\n\nMy background in software engineering, particularly my experience with Python, React, and cloud infrastructure, aligns well with the requirements outlined in the job description. In my previous role as a Tech Lead Engineer at Sony Pictures Entertainment, I designed and architected a business application for secure delivery of sensitive legal documents, leading sprint planning and overseeing production issue resolution. My responsibilities included modernizing a legacy Angular.js and Java Spring Boot codebase, upgrading frameworks, and remediating security vulnerabilities.\n\nPrior to that, as a Software Engineer at Sony, I developed core business logic for backend billing and finance systems using Java Spring Boot and enhanced user experience by developing advanced UI features with Angular. I also served as an Environmental Manager, ensuring the stability of non-production environments.\n\nMy projects showcase my proficiency in full-stack development. For example, in the \"Animedia\" project, I utilized GraphQL for API interactions, created database schema designs with Prisma, and implemented user authentication with NextAuth. Similarly, in \"Bambino,\" I designed a mobile-first baby management system with TailwindCSS and integrated Firebase Authentication. The \"Dolores\" project particularly highlights my ability to optimize backend performance at scale, where I ETL'd over 10 million records with PostgreSQL, implemented Redis data caching, and deployed on AWS EC2, achieving a 60ms average response time with 0% error rate under heavy stress testing.\n\nI am proficient in a wide range of technologies, including Node.js, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, AWS, Docker, and various testing frameworks such as Jest and React Testing Library. I am confident that my skills and experience make me a strong candidate to contribute to LawnStarter's engineering team and help build scalable APIs, automate workflows, and improve reliability at scale.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further.\n\nSincerely,\n\nYasin Khan"
