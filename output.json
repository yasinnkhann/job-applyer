        "question": "Why do you want to work at LawnStarter?",
        "answer": "LawnStarter's mission to simplify lawn care and empower local businesses resonates with my passion for using technology to solve real world problems. The opportunity to contribute to a platform that directly impacts people's lives, combined with your focus on Python, React, and cloud systems, aligns perfectly with my skills and interests.

      {
        "question": "Describe your experience with Python and React.",
        "answer": "I have extensive experience with both Python and React in professional and personal projects. I've used Python extensively for backend development, including building APIs with frameworks like Flask and FastAPI, as well as for data processing and automation tasks. On the front end, I've developed numerous user interfaces with React, leveraging its component based architecture and state management libraries like Redux to create dynamic and responsive applications. My project \"Animedia\" demonstrates my proficiency in React."

        "question": "Tell us about a time you automated a workflow successfully.",
        "answer": "At Sony Pictures Entertainment, I automated the process of generating data fix scripts for our Oracle and MarkLogic databases. Previously, this was a manual and time consuming task, often prone to errors. By developing Python scripts that automatically identify and correct data inconsistencies, I reduced the processing time by 80% and significantly improved data accuracy, freeing up valuable time for the team to focus on other critical tasks. This automation also improved compliance and ensured more consistent data quality across our systems."

    "CoverLetter": "Dear LawnStarter Hiring Team,\n\nI am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Software Engineer position at LawnStarter. I've been consistently impressed by LawnStarter's commitment to innovation and streamlining the lawn care industry, and I'm eager to contribute my skills to a company that's transforming a traditionally offline market.\n\nMy experience as a Tech Lead Engineer and Software Engineer at Sony Pictures Entertainment has equipped me with a strong foundation in building scalable and reliable applications. I have a proven track record of designing, developing, and deploying full-stack solutions, and I'm particularly excited about the opportunity to apply my Python and React expertise at LawnStarter.\n\nFor example, as Tech Lead, I architected a business application for secure delivery of sensitive legal documents. This involved leading sprint planning, managing production issues, and modernizing a legacy Angular.js and Java Spring Boot codebase. Furthermore, in my project \"Dolores\" I optimized a backend to handle thousands of users, ETL'ing over 10 million records with PostgreSQL, implementing Redis caching, and deploying on AWS EC2 with NGINX load balancing. I was able to achieve an average response time of 60ms for 10,000 clients/sec with a 0% error rate. My experience with databases like PostgreSQL and MongoDB, as well as cloud platforms like AWS, aligns directly with the requirements outlined in the job description. My personal project, Animedia, utilized GraphQL for API interactions, TypeScript for end-to-end type safety, Prisma for database schema design, and NextAuth for OAuth providers, showing my ability to contribute to modern and scalable architectures.\n\nI'm proficient in a wide range of technologies including Python, React, Node.js, and have hands-on experience with testing frameworks and Docker. I am confident in my ability to quickly learn new technologies and contribute meaningfully to LawnStarter's engineering team.\n\nThank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience can benefit LawnStarter.\n\nSincerely,\n\nYasin Khan"
